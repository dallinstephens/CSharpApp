# Overview

### What I am trying to accomplish as a Software Developer
As a Software Developer I am trying to create a real world application to help the business I am currently working for. I am learning how to interact better with the Gemini AI search engine to build meaningful applications. As well, I am trying to gain a better general understanding of certain programming languages and tools through the use of artificial intelligence.

### Description of Software
The primary programming language used in this program is C#. The project is built primarily with ASP.NET MVC Core. This program is an application that pulls data from a Google Spreadsheet to create an online store for retailers. The idea is that the program can be used so that retailers can create orders so that the publishing company can keep them supplied.
